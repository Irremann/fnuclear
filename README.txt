Minetest uranium tools Mod by Irremann

Add uranium tools: axe, crowbar, pickaxe, shovel, sword, hammer, sickle. Add uranium lamp and barrel for toxic waste.
They all created from depleted uranium 0%. All these tools glow in the dark (required wielded_light mod).
The sickle works like a scythe from the farming mod. The hammer smashes any cobblestone and any stone into gravel. And gravel and compressed gravel into sand.
Also added several recipes for disassembling diamond and mese tools using a hammer.
